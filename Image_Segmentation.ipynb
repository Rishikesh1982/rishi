        "Definition of Image Segmentation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Image segmentation is a process in computer vision where an image is divided into multiple segments or regions, each representing a meaningful part of the image. The goal is to simplify the image for easier analysis by identifying boundaries, shapes, and regions of interest based on pixel similarity, such as color, intensity, or texture. Each segment is a collection of pixels that share certain attributes or are part of the same object.\n",
